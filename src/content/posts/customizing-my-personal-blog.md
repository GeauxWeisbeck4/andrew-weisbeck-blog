Well today has been the first time that I have gotten to sit down and work on my personal blog since I finished the Astro Blog Tutorial last week - you can read about that experience here at my very first blog post.

I don't have a lot of time right now to get to do what I want to unfortunately - I have to go panhandle to survive currently, given that I am homeless and have to survive on a day-to-day basis. So I have decided to share with everyone what I have accomplished so far and where I plan on going with this little project!

## Adding Tailwind CSS

So Tailwind CSS is going to be my way of styling this website, due to it's awesome Utility CSS features that allow me to easily make this project look beautiful without having to sit and write a lot of custom CSS. I know some people don't like Tailwind CSS for whatever reason and one could say that it doesn't showcase my CSS abilities very well, but I assure you I understand CSS quite well. I've been coding for over three years at this point and CSS was the second thing I learned - well kind of the first actually because I really have always understood HTML.

There are a few things I want to do with Tailwind CSS for this project that will:
    1. Make it unique for my project
    2. Showcase my knowledge of Tailwind CSS
    3. Show my understanding of design principles
    4. Make styling my website easier
    5. Make my website look beautiful!

So here are some to-do items for Tailwind CSS:

- [x] Install Tailwind CSS and the Typography and Form plug-ins
- [x] Create a custom color palette for my favorite sport teams
- [ ] Create dark, light, and team themes for my website
- [ ] Add custom utilities to my Tailwind Config file
- [ ] Style my website with Tailwind CSS

## Create Components With Svelte, Preact, Lit, and Vue

I don't want to utilize just one JavaScript framework for this project. Maybe it's to show off my obsession for JavaScript frameworks that has sent me down learning rabbit holes the last few years and kept me from accomplishing many career goals of mine, or possibly it is to learn more about each framework - regardless of whatever subconscious reasoning I have, I think it will be a fun practice that will showcase my versatility as a developer.

## Add Astro Integrations to Make Development Easier

There are so many awesome [Astro Integrations](https://astro.build/integrations/) available for you to customize your Astro website with. Take a look for yourself at the 24-page long (and always growing) list of integrations that have been contributed by Astro's awesome community of developers.

This will show my flexibility as an Astro developer in a couple ways. For one, I will figure out how to integrate these packages successfully into my project, which isn't always necessarily easy considering the diversity in plug-ins that have been created. It will also show you that I have an understanding for the Astro framework by being able to complete some of the most basic functions of this website framework.

## Add Strapi CMS to the Backend of my Blog

[Strapi CMS]() makes creating content a breeze, once you have installed it and customized it to the needs of your project. It also makes it easier to manage you content, especially when you have lots of blog posts, notes, and media that you need to use for your project. Thus, this is the goal of any content management system - managing content!

This undertaking is going to have to occur on a day when I have more time. For now, I will stick with writing markdown on GitHub and on VS Code as an easy way to publish my content.

Here is a general idea of what I want to do with my Strapi CMS-Astro Backend:

1. Use MongoDB or PostgreSQL to host and store my Strapi CMS content in a non-SQL database. I have to do more research on what will work best for me.
2. Create relations between media and content to make the flow of content creation easy for me.
3. Be able to add blog posts, notes, projects, videos, and other types of content that is able to grow with my needs for functionality. This will ideally be more of a digital garden type project then a blog as I build on the basics of this project.

## Add a Way for Viewers to Interact

I haven't decided how much interaction you, the reader will have quite yet, but I hope there will be multiple ways you can interact with this cool project. I for sure will add comments to each blog post and likely a guest book that visitors can sign and say "Hola!".

I've always had a dream of having thousands of people respond to poll questions on a daily basis. Mainly to fulfill my curiosity on certain topics, but also I'd like to generate discussion on important issues of our day. Maybe a forum could be built on top of a daily poll? Maybe that's a different project? But I'd like to experiment with a polling page to engage my readers more.

## Contact/Follow Me/Donation Page

I want you to subscribe to my newsletter, so that component will be coming soon. I also want you to follow me on all my social media accounts, so this is a top priority. But I'd also like for you to donate to my cause or purchase anything I fancy on selling, especially since I am so financially desperate right now (haha... seriously...) and could really use the help.

For now it might just be throwing my CashApp handle out there, but I'd like to add the ability to donate cryptocurrencies and provide flexible ways for you to help me get out of homelessness!

## Much More to Come

Well this is just a shortlist of what I have thought of so far for this project - I want it to really display my skills and my personality for everyone to see. There are many more ideas I currently have and will have down the line.

Stay tuned to see these awesome ideas developed and what other ideas I come up with!

You can follow this project on it's [GitHub Repository here](https://github.com/GeauxWeisbeck4/andrew-weisbeck-blog) with a To-Do list in the ReadMe, open issues, and a Project Kanban board. I hope you enjoy following my blog and my journey as I turn it into one of the raddest personal Astro sites on the web!
