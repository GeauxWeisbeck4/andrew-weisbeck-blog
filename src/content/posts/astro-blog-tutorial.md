You know, to be completely honest - I never really sat down and did a complete Astro tour before I sat down last week and completed the [Official Astro Blog Tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) that you can find on the [Astro Documentation Site](https://docs.astro.build/).

I had been building Astro websites somewhat flying by the seat of my pants and there were some key concepts that I had missed by never completely walking through building a blog site from scratch. While I understood how Astro worked in general, I really don't think I could have ever been an effective Astro developer until I finished this fun little tutorial today.

Here are some of the things I picked up that I didn't quite understand - I'll spare you the drudge of sharing every little detail you will learn as you can explore that yourself when you complete the tutorial!

**If you haven't completed this tutorial yet, I highly recommend it - it's fun, simple, and very enlightening. You can consider yourself an Astro pro after doing it.**

## What I learned from the Astro Tutorial

1. **Astro Basics**: This is verbatim what was included from the initial post you create in the tutorial about what you will accomplish during the Astro tutorial:

    1. Installing Astro - First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.
    2. Making Pages: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.
    3. Making Blog Posts: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!
