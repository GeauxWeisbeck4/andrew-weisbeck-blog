Well today was almost typical of any other day, despite the important fact that I have jumped back into working on coding pretty daily again! This is quite an exciting development for myself as I have neglected important practice that is necessary to keep my skills in the loop.

## What I Worked On

**Project**: *My Personal Site - weismind.netlify.app*

So I spent the early morning hours (before panhandling) adding integrations to my project, adding blog posts, and starting to tackle creating components and adding various sections to my website.

I found a great example of how to use Astro, Svelte, and Typescript to create components/sections that will compose of my personal website. Credit to [Dicha Zelianivan Arkana](https://elianiva.my.id/) for her personal website and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/elianiva/elianiva.my.id) that have served as learning tools for this project. I am creating the work section, project cards, and blog posts, loosely based on her method of using Typescript and Svelte in conjunction with Astro.

I also worked on creating my Tailwind config file by adding my favorite team colors to the theme part of the configuration. There are a few projects I am referencing to do this, that I will share shortly.
